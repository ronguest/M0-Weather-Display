M0 Weather Display
========

* The project was derived from one by Daniel Eichorn (found via Adafruit) https://github.com/squix78/esp8266-weather-station-color
* Adapted for the M0 (so no eeprom) and also to use a Personal Weather Station (PWS) on wunderground.com
* The fonts were created by http://oleddisplay.squix.ch/
* The weather icons are stored on the SD card rather than being downloaded
* Currently using a 3.5" Adafruit TFT PID: 3651, 480x320. Formerly a 2.4" TFT, 320x240
