M0 Weather Display
========

* The project was derived from one by Daniel Eichorn (found via Adafruit) https://github.com/squix78/esp8266-weather-station-color
* Adapted for the M0 (so no eeprom) and also to use a Personal Weather Station (PWS) on wunderground.com
* The fonts were created by http://oleddisplay.squix.ch/
